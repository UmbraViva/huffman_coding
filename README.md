# Huffman Coding
The program was supposed to be an implemintation of the Huffman coding compression algorithm,
what it actually does is converts the text in an input file into huffman codes and then writes
them to a file. It's really more of an inflation algorithm I guess... If you have suggestions
of what I'm doing wrong, let me know.

## Building and running
The project uses CMake so you can build the project with that by
make a build directory inside the project and then run the comand below to to build the executable.
```bash
cmake ..
make
```


You can run the program with
```bash
./huffman_coding <file to decompress>
```
